Therefore if the example is too large such as one whole wikipedia article then for all the words in forward pass and then calculating gradients for all the words and updating the gradient is not practical. Because it will take long in fact model will not converge. Therfore we will calculate loss only after a certain number of steps say 100 and so on. By doing so the forward pass and all the hidden time step remains the same but the backward pass and gradient calculations become easier because we only calculate gradients over the stepped loss. we call this method **Truncated Backpropagation** through time.\n",
