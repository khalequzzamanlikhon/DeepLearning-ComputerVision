    "# Linear Classification\n",
    "In the last section we introduced image classification using K-NN algorithm. K-NN has disadvantages.\n",
    " - The classifier must remember all of the training data and store it for future comparisons with the test data. This is space inefficient because datasets may easily be gigabytes in size.\n",
    " - Classifying a test image is expensive since it requires a comparison to all training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Overview**:\n",
    "  We are now going to develop a more powerful approach to image classification that we will eventually naturally extend to entire Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The approach will have two major components: a score function that maps the raw data to class scores, and a loss function that quantifies the agreement between the predicted scores and the ground truth labels. We will then cast this as an optimization problem in which we will minimize the loss function with respect to the parameters of the score function.\n"

    "In the previous lecture we learned to work with data having a set of hyperpaarameters. For linear classifier weights are hyperparameters. For different set of hyperparameters we get different predictions. The questions is , which hyperparameters should we use in our model. In other words, which parameter set is best to use in our model. To get intuition about this question \"loss\" comes to the picture. In machine learning we want our model to predict as much as perfect. Say we want our a model to classify an image as cat. We want our model that every time it encounters an image it correctly predict as cat or not a cat. When model fails to predict correctly we consider it as loss. Therefore we can define loss as the difference between the predicted value and the actual value for a single example. Now the answer is, we will select that hyperparameter set that results the least loss.\n",

Because by penalizing weights we can control features. There are many regularized loss term availabe. But we will use squared L2 regularized term. $R(W) = \\sum_k\\sum_l W_{k,l}^2$.
