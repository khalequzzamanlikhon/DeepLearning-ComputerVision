# DeepLearning-ComputerVision

Main goal of this section is to understand the basic building blocks of computer vision and how deep learning is used for this particular task. This is inspired by Standford cs231. Maximum of these notebooks reflects the course. I modified my reading and understanding from the course in these notebooks. Moreover, I added some theoratical as well as some coding section to complete the understanding of some important topics.
